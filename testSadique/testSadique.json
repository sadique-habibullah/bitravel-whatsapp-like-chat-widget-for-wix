reflect the world we live in today, as technologies like artificial intelligence increasingly shape daily life. His works take the form of computer-generated films, sculptural installations, video games, and sound pieces, combining them into immersive story worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n🧠At the center of his practice are intelligent machines—self-driving cars, AI programs, and robotic figures—portrayed not simply as tools to serve humanity, but as protagonists with desires, memories, and complex inner lives.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n🔗Link below to plan your next visit!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\">This exhibition is curated by Claudia Mattos, Associate Curator of New Media Art.&nbsp;</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">𝙇𝙖𝙬𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙇𝙚𝙠: 𝙉𝙊𝙓 𝙋𝙖𝙫𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙤𝙣 </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> is funded by John S. and James L.

South Beach’s sun-soaked landscape and queer nightlife offered a spirited reprieve from the pressures of his New York City home base, with the freedom of inexpensive apartments and thrift-store finds helping fuel the undercurrent of wanderlust and escapism brewing in Pierson’s art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n🔗Link below to plan your next visit!</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">This exhibition is curated by James Voorhies, Curator at Large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n𝙅𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙋𝙞𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣: 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙈𝙞𝙖𝙢𝙞 𝙔𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙨 is made possible with generous support from Lisson Gallery and Regen Projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstallation view of&nbsp;𝙅𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙋𝙞𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣: 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙈𝙞𝙖𝙢𝙞 𝙔𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙨, 2025.

reflect the world we live in today, as technologies like artificial intelligence increasingly shape daily life. His works take the form of computer-generated films, sculptural installations, video games, and sound pieces, combining them into immersive story worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n🧠At the center of his practice are intelligent machines—self-driving cars, AI programs, and robotic figures—portrayed not simply as tools to serve humanity, but as protagonists with desires, memories, and complex inner lives.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n🔗Link below to plan your next visit!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\">This exhibition is curated by Claudia Mattos, Associate Curator of New Media Art.&nbsp;</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">𝙇𝙖𝙬𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙇𝙚𝙠: 𝙉𝙊𝙓 𝙋𝙖𝙫𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙤𝙣 </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> is funded by John S. and James L.
